# 🧠 Data Science Lab

Welcome to my **Data Science Lab**; the place where data turns into systems, models, and sometimes... unexpected discoveries.

I work at the intersection of **data engineering, machine learning, and deep learning**, building solutions that don’t just predict, but *understand* and *adapt*.  
Most of what you’ll find here started as an idea that got out of hand — and then became something useful.

## ⚗️ What’s This Lab About

This isn’t a “portfolio.”  
It’s a living collection of experiments, models, and analytics pipelines — each born from real-world challenges I’ve faced in production environments.  

Some projects aim to forecast performance, others optimize pricing or detect biometric patterns.  
All of them share a single purpose: **to turn information into impact**.

## 🔬 Featured Experiments

### 🧮 [Pricing Optimization (Machine Learning)]
A dynamic pricing system that models room rates based on seasonality, occupancy, and historical performance.  
Built with regression algorithms and custom feature engineering to maximize margin and demand balance.  

---

### 📈 [Business Forecasting (Time Series)]
A time series pipeline for predicting revenue and operational KPIs.  
Combines ARIMA, Prophet, and tree-based methods for robust short-term and long-term forecasts.  

---

### 🔍 [Customer Churn Prediction (Retention Analytics)]
A predictive model to estimate churn probability and recommend retention strategies.  
Trained with XGBoost, explained with SHAP — because transparency is just as important as accuracy.  

---

### 🧠 [Signature & Biometric Recognition (Deep Learning)]
CNN-based models for signature and biometric recognition.  
Developed with PyTorch and deployed using Docker and Keras — optimized for inference speed and scalability.

## 🧩 My Approach

I see data science as applied curiosity.  
Every dataset hides a pattern; every anomaly, a story; every model, a reflection of how we think.  
My work is driven by a mix of logic, experimentation, and a bit of obsession for clean systems that *actually work in production.*

I prefer **clarity over complexity**, and **results over buzzwords**.  
But I’ll still enjoy a good debate about loss functions over coffee.

## 🤝 Collaboration

If you’re working on:
- real-world ML and DL systems,
- brainlike CNN pipeline,
- production-ready pipelines,
- or just trying to make data behave better —

...I’m interested.  
Open to collaborations that mix science, software, and science reasoning.
